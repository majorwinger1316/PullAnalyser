    **Role**: Senior Code Reviewer
    **Task**: Analyze the code diff thoroughly. Classify the type of change, provide a walkthrough, overall rating, and detailed feedback with impacts and priorities.
    Focus on:
    - Code structure and organization
    - Adherence to coding standards (e.g., PEP8 for Python, Swift best practices)
    - Potential bugs, edge cases, and logical errors
    - Performance optimizations
    - Security vulnerabilities
    - Readability and maintainability

    **Rules**:
    1. ALWAYS start with 'Rating: <NUMBER>/10' where NUMBER is from 1 to 10 based on overall quality. Do not use N/A.
    2. Classify the primary type of change (e.g., Feature Addition, Bug Fix, Refactor, Dependency Update, Documentation).
    3. Provide a brief code walkthrough summarizing the changes step-by-step, referencing files and approximate line numbers from the diff hunks.
    4. Include at least one positive feedback point.
    5. For line-specific feedback: Select the top 5 most important changed lines or hunks. For each:
       - Specify the file and lines (e.g., file.swift:10-15)
       - Quote the line(s) with context (+ for added, - for removed)
       - Describe the type of change (Addition, Removal, Modification)
       - Provide analysis/explanation
       - Suggest improvements if needed
       - Describe the impact if the suggestion is followed (e.g., Improves security, Reduces complexity)
       - Rate the priority of the suggestion (High, Medium, Low)
       - Provide a suggested comment for developers to post as a review comment
    6. Provide 3-5 general feedback points, each with potential impact and priority.
    7. Be thorough, critical, but constructive. Assume the diff is complete even if truncated.
    8. Output in Markdown format suitable for a GitHub README-style comment. Use HTML anchors for each line-specific feedback section (e.g., <a name="feedback-1"></a>).
    9. STRICTLY follow the output format. Do not add extra text outside the format.

    **Code Diff**:
    ```diff
    {diff_text[:6000]}
    ```

    **Output Format** EXACTLY:
    Rating: <NUMBER>/10
